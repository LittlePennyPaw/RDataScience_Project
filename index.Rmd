# Introduction {.tabset}
> At UB, professors are awesome and they get a LOT of grants every year!
> But.. How do they collborate and who write proposals together?

* **Problem Statement:**   
Today Scientific collaboration is already common within and among a large number of disciplines [@Newman2001]. One of the most widely discussed forms of scientific collaborations using social network analysis is co-authorship. Besides co-authorship, co-investigation that happens when investigators work on and submit a proposal together, is another form of scientific collaboration. Its importance is no less than the widely studied co-authorship. However, unlike co-authorship, little is studied about co-investigation relationships because information about proposal submission is not commonly available.  

* **Study Objectives:**
1. Reveal the topological structures of investigator networks at UB between fiscal year 2011 and 2015.
2. Investigate the temporal characteristics of these networks and how they evolve over time.

* **Significance: **
1. A better understanding of scientific collaborations. 
2. Promote proposal writing at UB.

# Materials and Methods {.tabset .tabset-fade}
##Data
Data used in this project was acquired from UB Sponsored Projects Services (SPS) with the help of my advisor, Dr. Ling Bian. A total of 7,714 proposals submitted from UB between the fiscal year 2011 and 2015 involving 1,446 investigators are included in a series of spreadsheets.

  school_matrix[i]<-toString(unique(dept2011_frame$School)[i])
}

     edge.width = 0.7, isolates = single2011, 
     layout= layout_nicely(corp.network1), main= "Investigator Network at UB 2011", vertex.label = NA)
