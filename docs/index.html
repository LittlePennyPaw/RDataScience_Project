<h1>Introduction</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>At UB, professors are awesome and they get a LOT of grants every year!<br />
But.. How do they collaborate and who write proposals together?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong><br />
Today Scientific collaboration is already common within and among a large number of disciplines (Stefano et al., 2013; Newman, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c). One of the most widely discussed forms of scientific collaborations using social network analysis is co-authorship. Besides co-authorship (Newman, 2011). co-investigation that happens when investigators work on and submit a proposal together, is another form of scientific collaboration. Its importance is no less than the widely studied co-authorship. However, unlike co-authorship, little is studied about co-investigation relationships because information about proposal submission is not commonly available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Study Objectives:</strong> This project aims to reveal the characteristics of collaborative proposal writing at UB. There are three study objectives at three levels: the unversity level, the local/department level, and the individual level.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify the topological characteristics of unversity-wide investigator networks at UB between the fiscal year 2011 and 2015.</li>
<li>Test the community structure in a local investigator network at Geography Department.</li>
<li>Visualize the evolvement of an ego network featuring a star investigator over time.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significance: </strong></li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A better understanding of scientific collaborations.</li>
<li>Promote proposal writing at UB.</li>
<li>The approaches used can be applied to other institutions where research proposals are actively submitted.</li>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>Corresponding to the three research objectives, three sets of methods will be applied in the study.</p>
<p>Before diving into analyses, a university-wide investigator network is built for each fiscal year. In these networks, nodes represent investigators and edges are established if two investigators collaborated on a proposal. Single investigators will be represented as isolated nodes. Each node is assigned properties, including investigator ID, and his/her department and school affiliation. Each edge is also assigned properties, including proposal ID and whether it was awarded.</p>

<p><strong>1. Identifying Topological Characteristics at University Level:</strong><br />
Given the five investigator networks at the university level, three sets of metrics, i.e., density, average path length, and centrality are used to analyze their topological characteristics. <em>The density is used to explore whether the investigators often work with many other investigators. </em>The average path length over the network is utilized to identify the number of ‘investigator steps’ between two investigators. *The centrality metrics are introduced to identify the ‘star’ investigators who are central and critical in the network. The top five investigators with the highest values of degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality are identified. one of the top ‘star’ investigator will be featured in the individual level ego network.</p>

<p><strong>2. Testing the Community Structure at Local Level:</strong><br />
A local network at Geography Department is constructed out of my own curiosity and whether it has community structure is tested using Newman-Girvan alrorithm. This algorithm of community detection is based on edge betweenness. Groups that consist of densely connected nodes and between which there are only looser connections will be filtered out(Girvan &amp; Newman, 2012). Edges with high betweenness values are removed sequentially in the algorithm and the community boundaries are determined.</p>
<p>The modularity of the result graph will be analyzed. A high modularity value will reflect the existence of the community structure in the local network. If so, the number of communities will be calculated.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>corp_geo &lt;- filter(corp_frame, grepl(&quot;GEO&quot;, ID1) | grepl(&quot;GEO&quot;, ID2))
networks_geo &lt;- graph.data.frame(corp_geo, directed = F)
V(networks_geo)$color &lt;- ifelse(grepl(&quot;GEO&quot;, V(networks_geo)$name), &quot;gold&quot;, 
    &quot;gray&quot;)
ceb &lt;- cluster_edge_betweenness(networks_geo)</code></pre>

<p><strong>3. Visualizing the Evolvement at Individual Level:</strong><br />
Ego networks are widely used to discuss social relationships (Leskovec &amp; Mcauley, 2012; Arnaboldi et al., 2012). The nodes in Ego networks consist of a focal node (‘ego’) and the nodes to whom ego is directly connected to (‘alters’). Based on the above analysis of topolocial characteristics, a ‘star’ investigator with high centralies across the five fiscal year will be chosen as an ego. An ego network will be built around him/her and the evolvement of this ego network will be visualized in motion.</p>

<h2>Topological Characteristics at University Level</h2>
<p>The table below showws that density is very low for all fiscal networks compared to previous studies on scientific collaboration networks (Newman, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c). This observation implies that the network is sparse. Investigators in these networks do not collaborate very often with many others across the campus, although they may have their own dedicated collaborators. One reason behind this situation may be the requirement of certain types of proposals. For example, the Career Award of the National Science Foundation (NSF) requires only one investigator.</p>
<p>The average path length ranges from 4.771 to 6.270 during the five fiscal years, meaning that it takes about 4 to 6 ‘investigator steps’ for two investigators to work together. These values are similar to previous studies on scientific collaboration networks (Newman, 2000; Barabási et al., 2002) and can be all seen as small. This low values indicate a strong interconnection between investigators in the already established groups.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>This project applies social network analysis to explore the characteristics of collaborative proposal writing at UB during fiscal year 2011 and 2015. Different investigator networks at three levels are built and analyzed.</p>
<p>The study of topological characteristics of university-wide investigator networks over the five years shows that the networks are very similar to each other in structure. Of the first two sets of network metrics, the rather low values of density imply that a large number of investigators do not collaborate with others at all or only collaborate with a few. The small value of average path length for each fiscal year indicates a strong interconnection between investigators in the already established groups. The analysis of three centralities for each fiscal year network illustrates that investigators with highest values of centrality are mainly from School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. Some investigators are active in scientific collaborations over the five years.</p>
<p>At the local level, study on the investigator network at Geography Department reveals the existence of community structure. Investigators from Geography Department formed 10 small communities with investigators from other departments over the 5 years. This result iterates the above finding that investigators have strong interconnections in their established groups.</p>
<p>At a even finer scale, the individual level, the ego network around a ‘star’ investigator is animated. From the dynamic network, additions of the new alters and edges are clearly identified. The few addition of new alters in 2013 raises a hypothesis that the collaboration group around this investigator is nearly fully formed at that time.</p>
<p>Findings from this project lead to a conclusion that the topological characteristics of investigator networks at UB are similar to other scientific collaboration networks discussed in previous studies (Newman, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c; Barabási et al., 2002). Investigator within the established groups have persistent collaborations over the time. This small circle collaboration may be due to the commonly referred comfort zone phenomenon where investigators tend to collaborate repeatedly with former collaborators because they are familiar with each other’s ideas, methods, and equipment. It is also highly possible that proposals may take a number of years to succeed, so some investigators may work together for several years. Another reason may be that a group of investigators collaborate on different proposals of a similar topic and take turns being the lead investigator.</p>
